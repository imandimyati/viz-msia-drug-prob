      <h4>Drug abuse has always been Malaysia’s number one enemy that threatens to devastate the country from within by crippling its nation.
          It costs the country millions of ringgit to run drug treatment and rehabilitation programmes and Malaysia loses precious human capital that can help develop the nation.</h4>

      <p>In a parliament reply 31 March 2016, Deputy Minister of Home Affairs, Datuk Nur Jazlan Mohamed said that in the span of three years RM7.9 million has been spent on drug treatment and rehabilitation.
        Breaking it down, RM2.9 million was spent in 2013, RM2.45 million in 2014 and RM2.5 million in 2015. It is also estimated that the government has spent RM35 per day per person in hopes to address this issue.</p>

      <p>In this article, we explore a little bit on what was spent on and see whether there are room for improvements.
        The main source for data in this article comes from the National Anti-Drug Agency (NADA), a government agency under the Ministry of Home Affairs which manage matters related to drug abuse in Malaysia.
        This agency is the primary agency to play a role in government efforts to create a Malaysia that is independent of the drug menace.</p>

        <h4>Cost of Compulsory Rehab: Barely any change, no decrease to number of residents</h4>

        <p>The drug rehabilitation institution, or better known as Pusat Serenti in the beginning, has now been renamed as Pusat Pemulihan Penagihan Narkotik (PUSPEN) in 2009. In English, Narcotic Addiction Rehabilitation Centre. Later in 2012, in line with Malaysia’s Transformation Programme, it was rebranded to Cure and Care Rehabilitation Centre (CCRC). </p>
        <p>This is a rehabilitation programme within the institution, which means resident entry is based on court orders under Section 6(1)(a) Drug Dependants (Treatment and Rehabilitation) Act 1983. It is a compulsory drug rehabilitation programme run by the Malaysian government.</p>
        <p>Before the transformation programme, it used to be a regimented, tough and rugged programme. However, after criticisms from various quarters – mostly human rights activists – it has been changed to a more humanistic approach with the concept of fun, effective and easy to implement. The treatment and rehabilitation programme duration can been shortened (6-11 months) if residents pass the evaluation criteria under Section 12(2) Drug Dependants (Treatment and Rehabilitation) Act 1983. </p>
        <p>The programme also meet the needs of the resident better, based on the assessment of their categories and levels of severity of dependence and addiction to drugs. Based on the analysis done on the data provided by NADA, the average cost of compulsory rehabilitation programme from 2010 to 2014, is RM186,354. Over these years, the centers have an average of 5,324 residents. </p>
        <p>Based on NADA report, the cost a day for one person is RM8 for food and drink. RM27 is spent on miscellaneous things such as emolument, staff, services and supply. This translates to RM35 per person, per day. The chart below shows how there are little changes to the number of residents and the amount spent on compulsory rehab. While the chart shows an upwards and downwards trend, changes are only around -0.06% to 0.13%. </p>

        <h4>Narcotic Agency Spending: Huge chunk goes to operation</h4>

        <p>As a government agency under the Ministry of Home Affairs which manage matters related to drug abuse in Malaysia, a lot of money pumped into NADA are effort made to tackle drug abuse. On 19 November 2015, a parliamentarian had asked the Minister of Home Affairs how much NADA has spent to tackle drug abuse. </p>
        <p>The answer was ever since 2008 until August 2015, the estimated spending by NADA has total up to RM2,446,471,280.97. That is RM2.5 billion in the past seven years and around RM350 million for each year. The chart below shows that a bulk of the spending is spent on operation. This comes as no surprise, NADA objectives are to prevent someone from getting involved with drugs, to treat and rehabilitate drug addicts, to prevent relapse and to combat the supply, trafficking and abuse of drugs. </p>
        <p>Prevention, treatment and rehabilitation and enforcement – all these falls under the cost of operation. There are many services that NADA operates such as Cure and Care 1Malaysia Clinic, the CCRC, and the Caring Community House. To better understand, if we look at numbers, there are 12 Cure and Care 1Malaysia Clinic, 19 Cure & Care Rehabilitation Center, 59 Cure & Care Service Center and 75 Caring Community House throughout the country. </p>
        <p>From the chart, it shows that not much has changed in terms what NADA has spent on. Operation spending averages around RM290 million and development spending around RM28 million. </p>

        <h4>Drug Seizure: Millions worth of drug confiscated, cocaine the highest</h4>

        <p>Drug is big business, being close to the so-called notorious `Golden Triangle’ area doesn’t help. In the Southeast Asia region, the `Golden Triangle’ that comprised the common borders of Burma, Thailand and Laos is considered a drug-cultivation region. </p>
        <p>The most seized drug in both 2013 and 2014 is cocaine. Both years authorities have seized more than RM200 million. Unfortunately, a huge number of Malaysian drug addicts use opiates – heroin and morphine. From 2010 to 2014, the number of opiates users range from 49% to as high as 75%. This number is not reflected by the amount of heroin seized. </p>
        <p>Compared to cocaine, the estimated value seized for heroin is RM54 million in 2013 and RM26 million. Even when both years are combined, the number still pales in comparison to cocaine by at least RM100 to RM200 million. </p>
