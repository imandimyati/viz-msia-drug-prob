      <h4>Drug addiction doesn’t just affect the addict alone. It affects many aspects and has a far reaching effect from the addict’s own family, friends and to an extent, the society as a whole. We already know that tax payers’ money are used to fight drug abuse, but how far does it impact us socially?</h4>
      <p>In the case of family and friends, we can assume that drug abuse causes broken relationships. The person who is addicted may have a change of personality and is prone to mood swings, violent outbursts, secrecy and other forms of extreme behavior that may cause turmoil to relationships.</p>
      <p>With Malaysia as a country that highly regard family value and preserving the family name, drug abuse is no laughing matter. Family members may feel embarrassed or ashamed of such behaviour. They will be bothered by what others might think and are unsure as to what to do for the best. The costs of an addiction not only affect the addict but can also encompass family and friends. So, they may also have to shoulder the financial burden. </p>

        <h4>People in Rehab Programmes: People who could have been part of the workforce</h4>

        <p>It is no surprise that drug abuse causes loss in productivity, mainly due to labor participation costs, participation in drug abuse treatment, incarceration, and premature death. The addicts who are prison or PUSPEN/CCRC are most likely not working or contributing anything to the nation’s productivity as they are not part of the labour force. </p>
        <p>In 2014, around 18,000 people who could have been part of the labour force are unable to contribute to the nation. Instead, they have to serve out their sentence of being a drug addict. For those addicts who are, there are many stigma and discrimination that they do face. </p>
        <p>If they are not sober or fully weaned from drugs, it will impair their performance, increase the likelihood of absenteeism, disciplinary problems and even dismissal. The chart below shows the number of people who could have been part of a productive labour force. </p>

        <h4>HIV/AIDS Epidemic: Drug abuse contribute to spread of HIV/AIDS</h4>
        
        <p>Injecting drug or person who inject drug has been the main driving factor for the country’s epidemic. This is mainly caused by sharing needles. Thankfully, thanks to the Needle and Syringe Exchange Programme (NSEP) launched in February 2006, the number has decreased. </p>
        <p>Share of transmission through injecting drug use has declined significantly from 60-75% range in 1990s to less than 20% in 2014. </p>
